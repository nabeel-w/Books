# Book

This repository contains the code for a frontend application that interacts with the [Books_API](https://github.com/nabeel-w/Books_API) to manage a collection of books. The front end is built using React.js and allows users to perform Create, Read, and Delete operations on the books.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for managing books:
  - View all books in a list.
  - Add a new book to the collection.
  - Delete a book from the collection.
  - Search for books by title or author.

   ```


3. Start the application:

   ```bash
